# Glaucoma Detection
This project is my research to complete my bachelor degree at Mulawarman University. The title of my research is **A Comparison of MobileNet and EfficientNet Architechture on Glaucoma Classification Based on Fundus Image**. The result  could be seen on dashboard at <a href="https://bit.ly/dashboard_skripsi_bugi">bit.ly/dashboard_skripsi_bugi</a>.

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Collecting
The dataset used for building the model is fundus image. There are 4 fundus image dataset used. This 4 datasets choosen because it is clinically diagnosed by an ophthalmologist.
- **G1020** - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavjain1/glaucoma-datasets?resource=download-directory&select=G1020">dataset</a> - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09158">paper</a><br>
    This dataset is collected at a private clinical practice in Kaiserslautern, Germany between year 2005 and 2017. It consisted of 1020 images from 432 patients. The images are labeled as glaucoma (296 images) and healty (724 images).

- **RIM-ONE** - <a href="https://github.com/miag-ull/rim-one-dl">dataset</a> - <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345850772_RIM-ONE_DL_A_Unified_Retinal_Image_Database_for_Assessing_Glaucoma_Using_Deep_Learning">paper</a><br>
    This dataset were taken at Universitario de Canarian Hospital and Universitario Miguel Hospital in Madrid, Spanish. It was taken in year 2011(v1), 2014(v2), 2015(v3). The one used for this project is RIM-ONE DL that make specificcally for computeri vision dataset. It consist of 485  fundus images labeled as glaucoma (172) and normal (313).

- **REFUGE** - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavjain1/glaucoma-datasets?resource=download-directory&select=REFUGE">dataset</a> - <a href="https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/refuge-retinal-fundus-glaucoma-challenge">paper</a><br>
    This dataset is a competition dataset held by MICCAI on 2018. It consist of 1200 fundus images labeled as glaucoma (1080) and normal (120).

- **PAPILA** - <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PAPILA/14798004/1">dataset</a> - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01388-1">paper</a><br>
    This dataset were taken at General Universitario Reino Sofia Hospital in Murcia, Spain between 2018-2020. It consist of 488 fundus images labeled as glaucoma, suspicious, and normal.
